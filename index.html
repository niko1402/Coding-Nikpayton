                        <p>
                        I've made my home base in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, with my small growing family. My journey into tech has been anything but a straight line. I've been a professional musician since I was 16, and I have degrees in both Music and Business which have enabled me to work on both on and off stage. I started dabbling with web design many years ago when I realised that it was a way for musicians to take total control of their business without the need for labels, but never got around to pursuing it further.

                        <p>
                        When the Covid-19 pandemic canceled virtually all gigs, I had more than enough time to dive into learning to code, and I love it! Looking at clean, well-written code is like looking at a copyist's hand-written sheet of music, it brings a sense of calm and wellbeing. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my experience and eye for detail to come up with creative solutions using clean, elegant code.

                        <h3>Hand-coded HTML</h3>
                          <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate on, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                          <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
